### Boxscore User Experience

The ultimate goal is to display daily NBA boxscores on a single, web page, just like you would read a newspaper boxscore.  This will eliminate the need for multiple clicks when searching for boxscore information on your favorite website.

* User lands on a home page that displays the daily boxscores.  On this page, the user has the option to Sign Up or Log In.  If the User Signs Up or Logs In, the User’s Favorite Team(s) boxscores will be displayed at the top of the boxscores list
* If the User clicks “Sign Up,” the User lands on a page where the user can register to the site by entering:
	- Screen Name (Editable)
	- Email
	- Password
* After signing up, the User lands on the “Select Favorite Team(s)” page.  On that page, the User can select their favorite teams
	- Favorite teams can be modified via a “Settings” page
* Let the User Delete their account
* Disable Future Dates on Calendar

* Stretch Goals
	- Add Schedule feature for future dates
	- Add Standings
	- Add League Leaders
	- Add Goto “Today” on the Date Picker calendar
	- More secure if you make third party API calls from the server as opposed to the client
	- Add Other Leagues
